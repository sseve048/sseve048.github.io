         <p>I am a Junior Information Technology Major at Bob Jones University. My minor is in aviation which I am studying at USAeroFlight
             at the Greenville Downtown Airport <a href="https://usaeroflight.net/">usaeroflight.net</a>. I currently have my Private Pilot's Certificate with an Instrument Rating and am working toward

         <p>
            I enjoy spending time with my brother, going on outings with my society, and taking flight lessons. I love to read, play chess and
             ping pong and ride my dirtbike in my spare time.

             I live on a small organic family farm in Grundy County IL. Most of my spare time in the summer is spent working with my family to grow,
             package, market, and sell our products.
