        <h1>STEPHEN SCHAUB</h1>
        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying computer science with a minor in music. 
             I work on the grounds crew and accompany voice lessons. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach efforts with my society and 
            my church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church. I help to hold services and visit with 
            residents in nursing homes, and I actively volunteer my 
            time at my church by singing in the choir and assisting in youth ministry programs.
         </p> 
         <p>
             I enjoy running, reading, and visiting pipe organs in my spare time.
         </p>
